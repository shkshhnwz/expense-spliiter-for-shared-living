🚀 Why This App Works for Both Living & Travel

The core logic — adding members, adding expenses, splitting amounts, finalizing payments, and exporting PDF summaries — is universal.
That makes the app equally effective for:

Roommates sharing utilities, groceries, and rent.

Friends on a trip splitting hotels, fuel, restaurants, shopping, or activities.

Any ad-hoc group splitting variable costs.
